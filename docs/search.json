My main goal is to understand the interactions between the various factors that we have available and to clarify which factors have a significant impact on diabetes outcomes.",

    "text": "1.2 Significance of the Project Question\nThis topic is important to me because of the shocking statistics surrounding diabetes; approximately 38 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, which is roughly 1 in 10 people. In this research effort, my goal is to investigate this issue in depth. I want to reveal the key factors that contribute to the development of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of educating people about diabetes prevention and encouraging them to be active in monitoring their health before the condition gets worse.",

    "text": "2.1 Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic regression allows me to interpret the coefficient of the regression model in terms of an odd ratio. It gives a clear understanding of how each of the variables contributes to the model outcome. It is particularly useful in finding how influential a variable is. The main reason that I have chosen logistic regression is because of the binomial outcome, it would not be as meaningful for linear regression or else. I will also conduct a deviance test and Pearson chi-square test to ensure the logistic regression is a meaningful model to analyze and make predictions.",

Prediction is then conducted by assigning to a new observation the mean/median/mode (or maximum class probability) of the response computed over the region to which the new observation belongs to. Tree classification will also give us a meaningful visual representation of the variables.",

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nThis dataset have missing values, they uses ‘0’ to fill in the dataset beforhand so I am not able to tell rather the ‘0’ means missing or the real response is actually zero. Expect for the ‘Outcome’ variable, ‘0’ indicate no diabeties.\nFrom the summary, variable ‘Pregnancies’ have 111 responses are ‘0’ which I will not mutate this column. Since this dataset is all females at least 21 years old, I do believe that some of the zeros for pregnanices does mean no pregnanices history.\nThere is 5 missing values for ‘Glucose’, 35 missing values for ‘BloodPressure’, 277 missing values for ‘SkinThickness’, 374 missing values for ‘Insulin’, 11 missing values for ‘BMI’, and no missing values for ‘DiabetesPedigreeFunction’ and ‘Age’. I would replace zeros with the median of the non-zero values, median is robust to outliers and is commonly used in medical datasets.\n\n\nCode\n# Columns where 0 is considered missing (except 'Pregnancies' and 'Outcome')\nmissing_cols &lt;- c(\"Glucose\", \"BloodPressure\", \"SkinThickness\", \"Insulin\", \"BMI\")\n\n# Replace 0 with median of non-zero values in the specified columns\nfor (col in missing_cols) {\n  median_value &lt;- median(df[[col]][df[[col]] != 0], na.rm = TRUE)\n  df[[col]][df[[col]] == 0] &lt;- median_value\n}\n\n# Check result\nsapply(df, function(x) sum(x == 0))\n\n\nbook \n   0 \n\n\nIn my study, the variable I propose to categorize and make inferences about “outcome”, indicates the potential diagnosis of diabetes. This variable determines whether a diabetes test result is positive (category value 1) or negative (category value 0). A remarkable aspect of our dataset is the “pregnancy” variable, with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 17, and a mean value of 3.845. It would be particularly informative to explore whether pregnancy is an important factor influencing the outcome of a diabetes diagnosis and to assess the degree to which it does so. In addition, common predictors such as body mass index (BMI) and age are expected to play an important role in determining outcomes.",
