My main goal is to understand the interactions between the various factors that we have available and to clarify which factors have a significant impact on diabetes outcomes. ## Significance of the Research Question\nThis topic is important to me because of the shocking statistics surrounding diabetes; approximately 38 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, which is roughly 1 in 10 people. In this research effort, my goal is to investigate this issue in depth. My goal is to reveal the key factors that contribute to the development of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of educating people about diabetes prevention and encouraging them to be active in monitoring their health before the condition gets worse.",
