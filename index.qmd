# Introduction

## Project Goal

The objective of my project is to draw inferences and predictions from patientsâ€™ diagnostic measurements related to the detection of diabetes, with a focus on uncovering patterns or relationships between variables. My main goal is to understand the interactions between various factors and clarify which ones have a significant impact on diabetes outcomes.

## Significance of the Project Question

This topic is important to me because of the shocking statistics surrounding diabetes, approximately 38 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, which is roughly 1 in 10 people. My objective is to investigate this issue in depth. I want to find out the key factors that contribute to the development of diabetes, with the ultimate goal of educating people about diabetes prevention and encouraging them to be active in monitoring their health before the condition gets worse.
